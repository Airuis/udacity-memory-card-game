## Instructions

A simple memory card game, you click on the cards to reveal the suit of the card, then try to match that card up with a suit of the same type. This continues until all of the cards are matched.

As soon as you click the first card, a timer begins. Also, your match attempts are logged as moves, and in turn affect the star rating (seen to the left of the move count) that you receive at the end of the game.

There is a refresh button to the far right that you can click to refresh the page and start the game all over again.

## Credits

The base HTML, CSS, and one of the JavaScript functions (shuffle) was provided by Udacity.

Some of the CSS for the card flip animation was found at the following site: https://davidwalsh.name/css-flip

The timer function was adapted from coding found at the following Stack Overflow thread: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2604450/how-to-create-a-jquery-clock-timer

All of the rest of the coding was done by me, Stephen Harding.
